## Learning Objectives:bulb:
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap) and you are not to use Javascript.

Here the final result:
